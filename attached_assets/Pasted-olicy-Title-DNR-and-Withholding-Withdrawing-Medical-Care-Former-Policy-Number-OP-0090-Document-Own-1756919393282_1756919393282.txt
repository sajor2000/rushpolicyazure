I. Policy

The purpose of this policy is to articulate Medical Center policies concerning Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and non-initiation and withdrawal of other medical treatments consistent with sound medical and nursing practice and current legal standards in Illinois. It supports patient autonomy and rights.

A. Principles Governing Rights and Responsibilities:

i. Competent patients have the right to participate in decision-making regarding their medical treatment.

ii. Incompetent patients have the same rights to care and comfort as competent patients.

iii. Medical and nursing staff are not obligated to provide care that is not medically indicated.

iv. Competent patients can refuse life-sustaining or death-delaying procedures.

v. Advance directives are honored when patients are no longer competent.

B. DNR Orders:

i. DNR decisions may involve non-initiation or withdrawal of other therapies but are treated separately due to their unique status.

ii. DNR orders are determined by the attending physician/APP based on medical appropriateness and patient consent.

iii. Discussions about DNR orders are documented in the patient's chart.

iv. DNR orders are entered into Epic following verbal and telephone order policies.

v. Existing therapies are continued unless specific orders are written.

vi. DNR orders are re-evaluated as clinically necessary.

vii. Advance directives guide decisions for incompetent patients.

viii. Living Wills or Durable Power of Attorney do not presume medical appropriateness of DNR orders.

ix. DNR orders do not modify other medical, nursing, or basic care services.

C. DNR Orders for Surgery/Invasive Procedures:

i. Required reconsideration discussions occur before procedural interventions.

ii. DNR orders may be suspended during procedures with informed consent.

iii. Suspensions last until discharge from the operating room/post-anesthesia care unit unless specified otherwise.

iv. CPR initiated during suspension may be discontinued consistent with non-initiation/termination policies.

v. Clinicians are not required to initiate therapies inconsistent with ethical practices.

D. Guidelines for Non-Initiation of Medical Therapies:

i. Medical and nursing staff are not obligated to provide care that is not medically indicated.

E. Guidelines for Withdrawal of Medical Care:

i. Withdrawal occurs when a patient is dead, with organ preservation techniques applied if consent for organ harvesting is present.

ii. Competent patients can refuse medical intervention.

iii. Withdrawal aligns with advance directives.

iv. Orders for withdrawal are entered into Epic by the attending physician.

Definitions and additional guidelines are included in the full policy document.
