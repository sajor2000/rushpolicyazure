# Overview

The Rush Policy Chat Assistant is a Next.js application that provides AI-powered policy document queries for Rush University Medical Center staff. This is a beta demonstration built to showcase intelligent policy search capabilities using Azure OpenAI GPT-4. The application allows users to search through 800+ policy documents using natural language queries and receive both synthesized answers and full policy details.

**Latest Update (October 18, 2025)**: Complete Rush University brand implementation with official color palette, modern web typography, WCAG AA accessibility compliance, and brand voice integration. The application now fully reflects Rush's visual identity and personality (Inclusive, Invested, Inventive, Accessible) across every interaction.

## Backend Architecture

The API layer follows Next.js API Routes pattern with several key endpoints:

- **Chat endpoint** (`/api/chat`) handles conversation management and Azure OpenAI integration
- **Health monitoring** (`/api/health`) provides basic application status
- **Debug endpoint** (`/api/debug`) tests Azure connectivity and diagnoses configuration issues
- **Environment testing** (`/api/test-env`) validates configuration without exposing sensitive data
- **Conversation reset** (`/api/reset`) allows users to start fresh conversations

The backend implements a **stateless design** with in-memory thread storage for demo purposes, though production would require persistent storage.

## Data Architecture

The application uses:

- **Azure OpenAI Assistants API** for conversation management and policy document retrieval
- **Vector store** containing 800+ Rush University policy documents for semantic search
- **Thread-based conversations** maintaining context across multiple queries
- **No persistent user data storage** - conversations are ephemeral for security

## Security Architecture

- **Environment-based configuration** with all sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Azure OpenAI enterprise security** with API key authentication
- **TLS 1.3 encryption** for all data transmission
- **Input validation and sanitization** on all user inputs
- **No PHI processing** designed specifically to avoid patient data
